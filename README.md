# Infolab-Utils

This repository holds useful functions for many basic tasks, eg. parsing PDB and Hbond files, job scheduling scripts, organizing data and performing calculations etc. The objective of this repo is to organize scripts so others in the lab can reuse or modify these scripts for their own purposes. As such, this requires more in-depth documentation of file inputs/outputs, functions, and basic calculations performed within the function.
